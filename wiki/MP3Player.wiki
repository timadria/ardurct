#summary Description of the MP3 Player project

===Principle===
Combine the <a href="http://www.sparkfun.com/products/10628">MP3 Shield</a> from Sparkfun with TouScruino and a battery: we have a portable MP3 Player.

===Why ?===
 * Only for education reasons since we can find a very good MP3 Player in the commerce.
 * Ah, hang on, we can personalize this one to adapt to the ambient noise or the ambient light and have a PROPER battery with LOOONG autonomy.

===Hardware===
 * Since the shield only has, for whatever reason, the 5V wired as power, we have to link the 3.3V pin with the output of the 3.3V regulator: quite easy to do.
 * We also have to remove the reset button since it is under the new IOREF pin...
 * Maybe cut the hole tabs to reduce the footprint.
 * The battery fits in between the 2 boards, making the player quite compact... OK, OK: it will never be a whatever nano.

===Software===
 * We will just use an AREA of the UI manager to show a list of files from the SD under the List tab. 
 * When a user clicks on a line in the list, we change tab to the Play tab.
 * One more tab for the options? Volume, backlight...
